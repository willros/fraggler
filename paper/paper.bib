  abstract = "Copy number variant (CNV) regions have been proven to have a
              significant impact on gene expression. Some of them have been
              also found to be associated to different human diseases. CNV
              genotyping is often prone to error and cross-validation with
              independent methods is frequently required. The platform of
              choice depends on whether it is a genome-wide discovery screening
              or a candidate CNV study, the cohort size and the number of CNVs
              included in the assay and, finally, the budget available. Here we
              illustrate a affordable approach to determine the CNV genotype
              using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
              spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and based on the quantitative
              determination of single nucleotide duplicated mismatches (SNDM)
              mapping the CNV region and a paralogue genomic region that is
              used as a two-copy reference. We have genotyped nsv436327, a
              common CNV mapping SIRPB1 intron 1 that has been associated to
              human personality behavior. SIRP cluster region was subjected to
              several ancestral duplication events what makes SIRPB1 CNV
              genotyping technically challenging. We designed three sets of
              primer pairs that amplified paralogue regions inside and outside
              the CNV, containing three SNDMs. Post-PCR extension analyses of
              sequencing oligonucleotides mapping immediately upstream each
              SNDM allowed us to quantify using MALDI-MS the proportion of PCR
              products derived from the CNV region versus the external
              reference. In contrast to other approaches, setting up this
              genotyping method requires an affordable investment.",

              number variation in the human genome, and has highlighted the
              part this variation may play in predisposition to common
              phenotypes. Some important genes vary in number over a high range
              (e.g. DEFB4, which commonly varies between two and seven copies),
              and have posed formidable technical challenges for accurate copy
              number typing, so that there are no simple, cheap,
              high-throughput approaches suitable for large-scale screening. We
              have developed a simple comparative PCR method based on dispersed
              repeat sequences, using a single pair of precisely designed
              primers to amplify products simultaneously from both test and
              reference loci, which are subsequently distinguished and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Determination of microsatellite lengths or other DNA
              fragment types is an important initial component of many genetic
              studies such as mutation detection, linkage and quantitative
              trait loci (QTL) mapping, genetic diversity, pedigree analysis,
              and detection of heterozygosity. A handful of commercial and
              freely available software programs exist for fragment analysis;
              however, most of them are platform dependent and lack
              high-throughput applicability. RESULTS: We present the R package
              Fragman to serve as a freely available and platform independent
              resource for automatic scoring of DNA fragment lengths diversity
              panels and biparental populations. The program analyzes DNA
              fragment lengths generated in Applied Biosystems\textregistered{}
              (ABI) either manually or automatically by providing panels or
              bins. The package contains additional tools for converting the
              allele calls to GenAlEx, JoinMap\textregistered{} and OneMap
              software formats mainly used for genetic diversity and generating
              linkage maps in plant and animal populations. Easy plotting
              functions and multiplexing friendly capabilities are some of the
              strengths of this R package. Fragment analysis using a unique set
              of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) genotypes based on
              microsatellite markers is used to highlight the capabilities of
              Fragman. CONCLUSION: Fragman is a valuable new tool for genetic
              analysis. The package produces equivalent results to other
              popular software for fragment analysis while possessing unique
              advantages and the possibility of automation for high-throughput
              experiments by exploiting the power of R.",

              While drug development efforts are underway, there are concerns
              that resistant strains will emerge rapidly. Indeed, antiviral
              drugs that target even conserved regions in other RNA viruses
              lose efficacy over time as the virus mutates. Here, we sought to

              their ability to mutate and could hence serve as better antiviral

              consistent and distinct sequence changes during infection. In

              changes in human evolution. An increase in dietary carbohydrates
              caused an increase in dental caries following the development of
              agriculture, mediated by the cariogenic oral bacterium
              Streptococcus mutans. Salivary agglutinin [SAG, encoded by the
              deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) gene] is an innate
              immune receptor glycoprotein that binds a variety of bacteria and
              viruses, and mediates attachment of S. mutans to hydroxyapatite
              on the surface of the tooth. In this study we show that
              multiallelic copy number variation (CNV) within DMBT1 is
              extensive across all populations and is predicted to result in
              between 7-20 scavenger-receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains

              mutation rate for a protein-coding locus, with a mutation rate of
              up to 5\% per gamete. Given that the SRCR domains bind S. mutans
              and hydroxyapatite in the tooth, we investigated the association
              of sequence diversity at the SAG-binding gene of S. mutans, and

  abstract = "Baseline correction methods based on penalized least squares are
              successfully applied to various spectral analyses. The methods
              change the weights iteratively by estimating a baseline. If a
              signal is below a previously fitted baseline, large weight is
              given. On the other hand, no weight or small weight is given when
              a signal is above a fitted baseline as it could be assumed to be
              a part of the peak. As noise is distributed above the baseline as
              well as below the baseline, however, it is desirable to give the
              same or similar weights in either case. For the purpose, we
              propose a new weighting scheme based on the generalized logistic
              function. The proposed method estimates the noise level
              iteratively and adjusts the weights correspondingly. According to
              the experimental results with simulated spectra and measured
              Raman spectra, the proposed method outperforms the existing
              methods for baseline correction and peak height estimation.",

  abstract = "High-throughput sequencing has been proposed as a method to
              genotype microsatellites and overcome the four main technical
              drawbacks of capillary electrophoresis: amplification artifacts,
              imprecise sizing, length homoplasy, and limited multiplex
              capability. The objective of this project was to test a
              high-throughput amplicon sequencing approach to fragment analysis
              of short tandem repeats and characterize its advantages and
              disadvantages against traditional capillary electrophoresis. We
              amplified and sequenced 12 muskrat microsatellite loci from 180
              muskrat specimens and analyzed the sequencing data for precision
              of allele calling, propensity for amplification or sequencing
              artifacts, and for evidence of length homoplasy. Of the 294 total
              alleles, we detected by sequencing, only 164 alleles would have
              been detected by capillary electrophoresis as the remaining 130
              alleles (44\%) would have been hidden by length homoplasy. The
              ability to detect a greater number of unique alleles resulted in
              the ability to resolve greater population genetic structure. The
              primary advantages of fragment analysis by sequencing are the
              ability to precisely size fragments, resolve length homoplasy,
              multiplex many individuals and many loci into a single
              high-throughput run, and compare data across projects and across
              laboratories (present and future) with minimal technical
              calibration. A significant disadvantage of fragment analysis by
              sequencing is that the method is only practical and
              cost-effective when performed on batches of several hundred
              samples with multiple loci. Future work is needed to optimize
              throughput while minimizing costs and to update existing
              microsatellite allele calling and analysis programs to
              accommodate sequence-aware microsatellite data.",
